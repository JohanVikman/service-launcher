This tool allows you to dynamically create and remove services.
It syncs with the Network Services Orchestrator to dynamically generate the site.

After the process finishes, you will see your new service in the site.

In addition, you can create and remove devices and see the alerts from NSO

**Source Installation**




**Source Installation**

As this is a Django application you will need to either integrate the application in your production environment or you can
get it operational in a virtual environment on your computer/server. In the distribution is a requirements.txt file that you can
use to get the package requirements that are needed. The requirements file is located in the root directory of the distribution.

It might make sense for you to create a Python Virtual Environment before installing the requirements file. For information on utilizing
a virtual environment please read http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/. Once you have a virtual environment active then
install the packages in the requirements file.

`(virtualenv) % pip install -r requirements.txt
`

To run the the application execute in the root directory of the distribution:
 - python manage.py makemigrations
 - python manage.py migrate
 - python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:<PORT>
